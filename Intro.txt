Components Of Computer Network:

NIC
	NIC is a device that helps the computer to communicate with another device.


Hub
	Hub is a central device that splits the network connection into multiple devices.

	When computer requests for information from a computer, it sends the request to the Hub. Hub distributes this request to all the interconnected computers.


Switches
	Switch is a networking device that groups all the devices over the network to transfer the data to another device.

	A switch is better than Hub as it does not broadcast the message over the network

	Switch sends the message directly from source to the destination.


Cables and connectors
	Cable is a transmission media that transmits the communication signals.


Router
	Router is a device that connects the LAN to the internet.
