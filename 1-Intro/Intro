What is Computer Network?

* A set of devices connected through links

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components Of Computer Network:

NIC (Network Interface Card):

* Is a device that helps computer to communicate with another device
* MAC or physical address is encoded on the network card chip to identify a network card uniquely

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hub:

* Is a central device that splits the network connection into multiple devices
* Send request to Hub -> Broadcast to entire network -> all devices check

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Switch:

* Is a networking device that groups all the devices over the network to transfer the data to another device
* Does not broadcast message to entire network

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Router:

* Is a device that connects LAN to internet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modem:

* Connects computer to internet over existing telephone line

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cables & Connectors:

To transmits communication signals

3 types of cables used:

	1. Twisted pair cable
	2. Coaxial cable
	3. Fibre-optic cable

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Types of Network Architecture:


Peer-To-Peer network:

* All the computers are linked together with equal privilege and responsibilities

Client/Server network:

* Designed for end users called clients, to access data from a central computer known as Server
* A server has Network Operating System(NOS) to provide data, and cost is very high

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computer Network Types:

* LAN(Local Area Network)
* PAN(Personal Area Network)
* MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)
* WAN(Wide Area Network)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAN:

* Is a group of computers connected to each other in a small area such as building, office

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

PAN:

* Arranged within an individual person, within a range of 10 meters
* Ex: Computer connected to Mouse, Headphone, Printer

2 Types:
	Wired: USB
	Wireless: WiFi, Bluetooth

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAN:

* Covers a larger geographic area by interconnecting a different LAN
* Ex: Communication of Banks in a city

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

WAN:

* Extends over a large geographical area such as states or countries

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internetwork:

* 2 or more computer network LANs or WAN


2 Types Of Internetwork:

1. Extranet: 

	* Based on the internet protocol such as TCP and IP
	* The access to the extranet is restricted to only those users who have login credentials

2. Intranet: 

	* Private network based on the internet protocol such as TCP and IP
	* An intranet belongs to an organization which is only accessible by the organization's employees

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Topology?

Structure of network of how all components are interconnected to each other

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bus Topology:

	* All the stations are connected through a single cable known as a backbone cable

Ring Topology:

	* Receives message from previous computer will retransmit to next

Star Topology:

	* Every node is connected to central hub (server)

Tree Topology:

	* Combines the characteristics of Bus topology and Star topology

Mesh Topology:

	* Interconnected with each other through various redundant connections

Hybrid Topology:

	* Combination of various different topologies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transmission modes (communication mode):

* The way in which data is transmitted 

3 categories:

1. Simplex mode (Unidirection)
	Ex: TV, Radio

2. Half-duplex mode
	Message flows in both directions, but not at same time
	Ex: Walkie-talkie

3. Full-duplex mode
	Both stations can send and receive message simultaneously
	Ex: Phone
