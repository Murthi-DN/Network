TCP/IP Model:

* Compressed version of OSI model with only 5 layers
* Is not exactly similar to OSI model
* The TCP/IP model consists of 5 layers:

	* Application layer
	* Transport layer
	* Network layer

	* Data link layer
	* Physical layer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Access Layer (Physical & Data Link layer):

* Defines how data should be sent physically through network

* The protocols used by this layer are:

	* Ethernet
	* Token Ring 
	* FDDI
	* X.25
	* Frame relay

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internet Layer (Network Layer):

* To send packets from any network, and they arrive at the destination irrespective of the route they take

* The protocols used by this layer are:

	* IP Protocol
	* ARP
	* ICMP

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transport Layer:

* Responsible for reliability, flow control, and correction of data

* The protocols used by this layer are:

	* UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
	* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application Layer:
	
* To interact with application

* The protocols used by this layer are:

	* HTTP
	* SMTP
	* FTP
	* DNS
	* TELNET
	* SNMP

-------------------------------------------------------------------------




-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IP Protocol:
	
	* Implements logical host addresses as IP address to identify devices

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):

	* To find MAC/Physical address from the IP address

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICMP Protocol (Internet Control Message Protocol):

	* Used for error handling
	* The core responsibility is to report problems

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is HTTP?

* Defines set of rules and standards on how data can be transmitted on Internet  
* A Stateless Protocol where each command is independent with respect to the previous command

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is HTTPS?

* Advanced and secured version of HTTP
* SSL/TLS protocol is used to provide security
* Enables secure transactions by encrypting data and also helps identify network servers securely

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is TCP protocol?

* Set of rules that decides how a computer connects to Internet and how to transmit data over network
* Creates a virtual network when more than 1 computer is connected to network
* And uses 3 ways hand-shake model to establish reliable connection

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the UDP protocol?

* Used for multicasting and broadcasting
* Almost same as TCP/IP Protocol except 3 ways of handshaking
* Uses a simple transmission without any hand-shaking which makes less reliable

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is IPv4 address?

* An IP address is a 32-bit dynamic address of a node in the network
* An IPv4 address has 4 octets of 8-bit each with each number with a value up to 255

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Handshaking?

* Establishe communication between 2 networking devices
* Ex: When 2 computers first connect with each other through modems, handshaking determines which protocols, speeds, compression, and error-correction schemes will be used during communication session

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Broadcasting?

* Transmitting a packet that will be received by every device on network

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Multicasting?

* Is group communication where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is MAC address in NIC?

* Media Access Control 
* A 48-bit or 64-bit unique identifier of devices in network
* Also called the physical address embedded with NIC (Network Interface Card)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is DHCP Protocol?

* Dynamic Host Configuration
* Auto-assign the IPs to devices which enables them to communicate over IP network

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
