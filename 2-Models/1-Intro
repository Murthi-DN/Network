Computer Network Models

	ISO has developed a layered approach. In a layered approach, networking concept is divided into several layers, and each layer is assigned a particular task. Therefore, we can say that networking tasks depend upon the layers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Layered Architecture

	The main aim of the layered architecture is to divide the design into small pieces.

	Each lower layer adds its services to the higher layer to provide a full set of services to manage communications and run the applications.

	The basic elements of layered architecture are services, protocols, and interfaces.

	Service: 
		It is a set of actions that a layer provides to the higher layer.
	Protocol: 
		It defines a set of rules that a layer uses to exchange the information with peer entity. These rules mainly concern about both the contents and order of the messages used.
	Interface: 
		It is a way through which the message is transferred from one layer to another layer.

A set of layers and protocols is known as network architecture.

OSI Model (Open System Interconnection)

	Is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.

	OSI consists of 7 layers, and each layer performs a particular network function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OSI model is divided into two layers:

Upper layers
	The upper layer of the OSI model mainly deals with the application related issues, and they are implemented only in the software.
	The application layer is closest to the end user. 
	Both the end user and the application layer interact with the software applications

Lower layers
	The lower layer of the OSI model deals with the data transport issues. 
	The data link layer and the physical layer are implemented in hardware and software. 
	The physical layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is closest to the physical medium. 
	The physical layer is mainly responsible for placing the information on the physical medium.

Responsible of Host

	Application Layer
		Provide services to User

	Presentation Layer 
		Responsible for translation, compression, encryption

	Session Layer 
		To establish, manage, terminate the session

	Transport Layer
		Provide reliabile message delivery from process to process, transmitted in the order in which they are sent and there is no duplication of data

		Data get converts into smaller units known as segments.

		2 protocols used in this layer are:

		TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
			It is a standard protocol that allows the systems to communicate over the internet.
			It establishes and maintains a connection between hosts.
			When data is sent over the TCP connection, then the TCP protocol divides the data into smaller units known as segments. 
			Each segment travels over the internet using multiple routes, and they arrive in different orders at the destination. 
			The transmission control protocol reorders the packets in the correct order at the receiving end.
			
		UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
			User Datagram Protocol is a transport layer protocol.
			It is an unreliable transport protocol as in this case receiver does not send any acknowledgment when the packet is received, the sender does not wait for any acknowledgment. 
			Therefore, this makes a protocol unreliable.


Responsible of Network

	Network Layer
		Responsible for moving packets from source to destination

	Data-Link Layer
		Used for error free transfer of data frames or  format of the data, translates the physical's raw bit stream into packets known as Frames

	Physical Layer
		Provides physical medium through which bits are transmitted
