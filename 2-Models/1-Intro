Computer Network Models:

* A Layered Architecture By ISO
* Networking concept is divided into several layers, and each layer is assigned a particular task

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Layered Architecture:

* Main aim of layered architecture is to divide design into small pieces
* The basic elements of layered architecture are services, protocols, and interfaces

Service: 
	Is a set of actions that a layer provides to the higher layer

Protocol: 
	Defines a set of rules that a layer uses to exchange information with other 

Interface: 
	Is a way through which message is transferred from one layer to another layer


A set of layers and protocols is known as network architecture

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OSI Model (Open System Interconnection):

* Is a reference model that describes how information from device moves through a physical medium to another device

* OSI consists of 7 layers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Application Layer:

	* Provide services to User

2. Presentation Layer:
	
	* Responsible for translation, compression, encryption

3. Session Layer:
	
	* To establish, manage, terminate session

4. Transport Layer:

	* Provide reliabile message delivery
	* Transmitted in order in which they are sent 
	* There is no duplication of data


Two protocols used in this layer are:

	TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

		* It is a standard protocol that allows the systems to communicate over the internet
		* It establishes and maintains a connection between hosts
		* TCP protocol divides the data into smaller units known as segments
		* Each segment travels over the internet using multiple routes, and they arrive in different orders at destination 
		
	UDP (User Datagram Protocol):

		* It is an unreliable transport protocol
		* Receiver does not send any acknowledgment when the packet is received


5. Network Layer:

	* Responsible for moving packets from source to destination

6. Data-Link Layer:
	
	* Used for error free transfer of data frames 
	* Translates physical's raw bit stream into packets known as Frames

7. Physical Layer:
	
	* Provides physical medium through which bits are transmitted

Data get converts into smaller units known as segments
